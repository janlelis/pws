A Clipboard based CLI Password Safe [<img src="https://badge.fury.io/rb/pws.svg" />](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pws) [![[travis]](https://travis-ci.org/janlelis/pws.png)](https://travis-ci.org/janlelis/pws)
===
**pws** is a command-line password safe/manager written in Ruby using [AES-256-CBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) and [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2).

2023 Notice!
---

Although the gem works well and as described, its cryptographic foundations have not been updated since 10 years ago and might not reflect current best practices.

Setup
---
Make sure your computer has Ruby installed.

You can then install *pws* with: `$ gem install pws`

Run `$ pws --help` for usage information.

If you use pws on Linux, you will need to have `xsel` or `xclip` installed (for the clipboard to work).

Tips &amp; Troubleshooting
---

### How to use a .pws file in the current working directory
Besides using the `--filename path/to/safe` option, you can shortly call `pws --cwd` for using a `.pws` file in the current directory.

Check the `.pws` into version control and you have a great way to share a project's passwords within your team.


### OpenSSL 1.0
You should use a Ruby that was built with bindings to an openssl version >= 1.0 or pws will fall back to a Ruby-only version of the PBKDF2 function, which is much slower. If using openssl 1.0 is not possible for you, you can work around that issue by using the `--iterations` option with a value below 75\_000 (see help). If you have problems using openssl 1.0 with your Ruby, please look for a solution in [this issue](https://github.com/janlelis/pws/issues/7).


### Updating from pws 0.9
The 0.9 password files are not compatible with the 1.0 version of pws, however, you can convert your safe with:
`$ pws resave --in 0.9 --out 1.0`


### Reading the source
Trust the code by reading the source! It's originally based on [this tutorial](https://ruby.janlelis.de/41-tutorial-build-your-own-password-safe-with-ruby). You might want to start reading in the [0.9.2 tag](https://github.com/janlelis/pws/tree/0.9.2), because it's got less features and therefore is less code.
